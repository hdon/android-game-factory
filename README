This program provides a simple generator for a game skeleton. To use, run:

python startproject.py com.example.package.name.to.use ../path/to/folder

It's that simple. It doesn't have many features, there are a few rough 
edges, and some of the *.properties files apply to my system right now, 
but it's useful for me and will save you about 15 minutes of duplicated 
effort if you begin with this :)

The project you get has three classes, is ready to use OpenGL, and will 
draw a line connecting two points on the display wherever you place your 
fingers.

TODO

 - Generate *.properties files.
 - Provide more control over class name casing.
 - Add sound!!!
